= Simple Tree

Demonstrates constructing a command tree to support multi-tiered command
structures.

The built tree has the following layout:

[source]
----
root
  |- foo
  |    |- bar
  |- fizz
       |- buzz
----

There are 2 branches from the root command that may be selected, "foo" and
"fizz".  Under the "foo" branch there is a singular leaf node, "bar".  Under the
"fizz" branch, there is a singular leaf node "buzz".

The command tree may have any number of branches and/or leaves.
