* [ ] Validate that optional positional arguments do not appear before required
      positional arguments.  Maybe make the optional argument required if it
      appears before a non-required argument and emit a warning?

* [ ] Add the "help" flag callback to all commands and commandnodes that do not have
      the "disableHelp" flag set.

* [ ] Render command aliases in the help text.

* [ ] Ensure command name/alias uniqueness only in build-tree and build-branch.
      It is pointless to check at the command-group level as you will just need
      to check at the tree/branch level again anyway to ensure the level itself
      is good.

* [ ] The "Usage:" help line for subcommands should print the full command path
      to the command in question.  For example `docker compose up [OPTIONS] [SERVICES...]`

* [ ] ExpectUnmapped(label string)
